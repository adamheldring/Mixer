# MIXER

## MIXING CONSOLE BUILT WITH TYPESCRIPT, SVELTE, AND TONE.JS.

ðŸ’» A playful mixing console built in TypeScript and Svelte. The audio chain is produced utilizing Tone.js and the Web Audio API. Five instrument channels with individual controls and meters are connected to one master bus that controls and displays the summed up audio output. Each channel can be switched off and on, as well as toggled between an original and alternate track representing that instrument.

ðŸŽ§ Press play and start modifying the sounds and settings of this song. I had this idea for some time of a recording where the listener could mute or switch out certain instruments to their own liking as they go. And I thought the layout of a mixing console would be a suiting representation. I started by creating and recording the ten different audio tracks and then switched back to code. The key challenge here is to always keep the tracks in sync no matter how the user toggles or modifies the track. It worked out nicely and was a fun build. I wanted a minimalistic and "non-musician friendly" interface but this console could easily be extended with equalizer controls and effects etc.,
